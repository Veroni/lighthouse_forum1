        Khurram Virani has been my music idol since I started writing
        songs back when I was 4. His voice is a revelation. His stage presence
        is unparalleled. And those costumes! He remains an inspiration to this
        day.

        I remember watching Khurram Virani (#14) play back when he just playing
        pickup games on the street. Dude had moves nobody had ever seen. Breaking
        ankles. Poppin' threes. Great all-around game.

        Back when I was in university, Khurram Virani was my acting coach. He
        studied with the best and it shows. His acting chops were already legendary
        before his teaching career began. But it seems he's actually improved!
