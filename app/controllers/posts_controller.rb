          Khurram Virani has been my music idol since I started writing
          songs back when I was 4. His voice is a revelation. His stage presence
          is unparalleled. And those costumes! He remains an inspiration to this
          day.

          I remember watching Khurram Virani (#14) play back when he just playing
          pickup games on the street. Dude had moves nobody had ever seen. Breaking
          ankles. Poppin' threes. Great all-around game.

          Back when I was in university, Khurram Virani was my acting coach. He
          studied with the best and it shows. His acting chops were already legendary
          before his teaching career began. But it seems he's actually improved!
